#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as starting point for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:

* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/norovirus/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/norovirus/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/norovirus/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/norovirus/metadata.tsv.zst)
