## Scope of this dataset

Based on the RdRp (polymerase) region, this dataset assigns genotypes to Norovirus samples based on [Calcivirus Typing Tool (CDC)](https://calicivirustypingtool.cdc.gov/becerance.cgi) and tree placement.

Strains picked from the table in:

* https://calicivirustypingtool.cdc.gov/becerance.cgi

There is a "Norovirus ORF 2 Genotypes (VP1 region)" Nextclade dataset based on the VP1 region available at `nextstrain/norovirus/VP1`
